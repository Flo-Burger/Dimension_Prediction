## Key Files

### Analysis
The main file needed for the analysis is the "running_Analysis.py" file which allows you to run the method for all models, datasets, and settings. It calls the activation extraction functions from the layer_extractions folder which contains one function/file for each model (and pixel extraction). It will also create all plots once the results have been fully created.

### Plotting
The plots are automatically created when running the "running_Analysis.py" file. If you just want to run the plots, you can use the "running_Plots.py" file. All plots can be found in the "Results" folder under "final_plots".
