## Datasets 

To repeat the analysis, you first need to download the data for the two dataset we used: 

*THINGS*: THINGS contains bla. You can download it under: https://osf.io/z2784/

For this, we need the 

*STUFF*: STUFF contains bla. To acess the data and dimensions, please bla. 

## Key Files

# Analysis
The main file needed for the analysis is the "running_across_all_models.py" file which allows you to run the method for all models, datasets, and settings. It calls the activation extraction functions from the layer_extractions folder which contains one function/file for each model (and pixel extraction). 

### Plotting
To re-create the plots, see the plotting folder which you have to run independent of the main analysis. Within each file, you can specify whether you want to plot THINGS or STUFF. To re-create figure 4, change the dataset from "THINGS" to "STUFF".
